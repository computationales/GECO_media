## Data variety {.build}

- Data isn't delivered as usable entities for any given program
- Requires certain software (libraries) to be read & manipulated
```{r eval=FALSE}
# common libraries and or functions to access data
read.table()
read.csv()
```
- Multiple ways of accessing data

## File formats

- Data format is defined by a file extension
- File extension is the last section of a file name after the last separating dot `.`
- For example in `my_file.csv`, here, `csv` is the file extension
- Describes the content of the file

## File formats
### File extensions

- Only part of the file name
- Ideally reflect the content, but not always
- `my_file.csv` and `my_file.whatever` can have the same content

## Readability

- Distinction between human readable and binary data
  - binary data != human readable

## Finding & using data {.build}

- World is data rich, finding the right data is key
- Read the documentation
  - motivate why you use particular data
  - make notes on particular limitations
- Understand the format (extension)
- Identify how to get the data

## Finding & using data
### Getting data

- Direct downloads
  - manually
  - not always structured
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
  - automatic
