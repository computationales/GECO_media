## History {.emphasized}

- Solution to the replication (reproducibility) crisis
  - originates in medicine / sociology
- The inability to reproduce the same results given the same data

## History {.emphasized}

- Deduction is not fully covered by the scientific method
  - inherent stochasticity

## Framework

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="image by The Turing Way", out.width="85%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducible-matrix.jpg")
```

## Case study: ocean acidification and fish behaviour {.emphasized}

- Ocean acidification makes fish take risks
- Profound effects on marine diversity and fisheries

## Ocean acidification and fish behaviour {.emphasized}

- Re-analysis and replication failed
- Bias and small sample sizes to blame

## Ocean acidification and fish behaviour {.emphasized}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Clements et al. 2022 (Plos Biology)", out.width="85%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("decline_effect.jpg")
```

## Ocean acidification and fish behaviour {.emphasized}

- **Decline effect**

## Ocean acidification and fish behaviour {.emphasized}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Enserik (Science 2021)", out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("sea_of_doubt.png")
```

## Open Science (Scholarship)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="redrawn from Persic 2021 (UNESCO, Wiki Commons)", out.width="85%", fig.align='center'}

```

## Reducing stochasticity in methods {.emphasized}

- Relying on open code & data
- Documented code & data processing
- Well structured projects

## Reducing stochasticity in methods {.emphasized}

- Quick code review
- Code re-use (replicability)

## Reducing stochasticity in methods {.emphasized}

- Well structured, consistent and readable
- Well documented
- Publicly archived

## Public archives

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="https://zenodo.org", out.width="85%", fig.align='center'}
