# GECO media archive

A collection of materials for outreach and the media. Media materials are
organized according to the venue.

The [conference folder](https://github.com/computationales/GECO_media/tree/main/conferences) includes prints of posters presented at various
conferences as well as links to online videos (e.g. Youtube materials).

The [publications folder](https://github.com/computationales/GECO_media/tree/main/publications) includes additional media files which were either too
large for the appendix of the publication or generated specifically for outreach
after the publication of a journal article.

## Media upload instructions

Generally keep image files under <350KB in size if used for online display. High resolution files can be included for reproduction, but try to keep file sizes for graphics <5MB if possible. Use `jpg` files for images, use `png` or `pdf` files for graphics (maps, charts, etc). If file sizes are tending to the large end compress data using `tar` or `zip` archiving methods.
