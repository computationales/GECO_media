# GECO media archive

A collection of materials for outreach and the media. Media materials are
organized according to the venue.

The [conference folder](https://github.com/geco-bern/GECO_media/tree/main/conferences) includes prints of posters presented at various
conferences as well as links to online videos (e.g. Youtube materials).

The [publications folder](https://github.com/geco-bern/GECO_media/tree/main/publications) includes additional media files which were either too
large for the appendix of the publication or generated specifically for outreach
after the publication of a journal article.

The [teaching folder](https://github.com/geco-bern/GECO_media/tree/main/teaching) includes teaching material in the form of (html) slides and other supporting information.

## Media upload instructions

Generally keep image files under <350KB in size if used for online display. High resolution files can be included for reproduction, but try to keep file sizes for graphics <5MB if possible. Use `jpg` files for images, use `png` or `pdf` files for graphics (maps, charts, etc). If file sizes are tending to the large end compress data using `tar` or `zip` archiving methods.

Try to limit the number of edits to large images as this will inflate the repository size, only commit and upload what you think is good enough (e.g. best to wait until after a conference so that you include last minute changes).
