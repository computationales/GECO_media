# GECO_media

A collection of materials for outreach and the media. Media materials are
organized according to the venue.

The conference folder includes prints of posters presented at various
conferences as well as links to online videos (e.g. Youtube materials).

The publications folder includes additional media files which were either too
large for the appendix of the publication or generated specifically for outreach
after the publication of a journal article.
