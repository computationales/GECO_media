# GECO_media

A collection of materials for outreach and the media. Media materials are
organized according to the venue.

The [conference folder](https://github.com/computationales/GECO_media/tree/main/conferences) includes prints of posters presented at various
conferences as well as links to online videos (e.g. Youtube materials).

The [publications folder](https://github.com/computationales/GECO_media/tree/main/publications) includes additional media files which were either too
large for the appendix of the publication or generated specifically for outreach
after the publication of a journal article.
